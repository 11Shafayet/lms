    description: `This course is taught by an award winning MBA professor with significant real world experience working at Goldman Sachs as well as in the venture capital, hedge fund and consulting industries (he has founded several companies and sits on several boards). Many business concepts are simply common sense. This course will focus on business concepts that you need to know that might not be common sense. This course makes the general business, accounting and finance process very easy to understand! The professor of this course is also the author of "101 Crucial Lessons They Don't Teach You in Business School," which Forbes magazine recently called "1 of 6 books that all entrepreneurs need to read right now."

      The contents of this course are all based on my work experience at several firms, including Goldman Sachs, the consulting industry at Accenture, a few companies I have started, the hedge fund industry where I worked at Citadel and also in the venture capital sector (the firm I founded had a venture capital investment in Facebook).I included helpful practical business concepts I learned while I did an MBA at Columbia University and a Bachelor of Commerce degree at McGill University. Think of this course as a “greatest hits” business summaries from my MBA, undergraduate business degree, work experience in consulting, equities, hedge funds, venture capital and starting my own companies.`,

    description: `Most photography courses concentrate on gear and tech, but cameras don’t take pictures! You take pictures and you are often overlooked in favour of the latest gadget or upgrade.

    There are only 5 camera controls you need. This comprehensive photography course is specifically designed to make them effortless and easy to combine with light, composition and grow your creativity - whatever your level of photographer.
    
    Photography is not as complex as some make out. It’s a bit of knowledge and a lot of practise - which is great news because you already love taking pictures right?

    First you’ll master the 3 exposure controls so you’ll know what they do, why they do it and be able to choose which settings to use. Exposure is not rocket science. It's just 3 controls and if you can get online and enrol on a course you can easily master 3 camera settings.

    Exposure settings have creative superpowers too and the next step is learning what they are and how to choose settings for creative reasons. Every photo you take is your photo and Masterclass will put you in control of how you want it to look.

    Manual mode is pretty simple TBH, and it's vital because cameras can’t think for themselves and sometimes get it wrong. Ever taken a photo of bright snow or a white sand beach in sunshine? Did it come out dark and dull looking? - That’s what I mean.

    Once you’ve mastered manual exposure, know why cameras get it wrong and what to do about it, you can effectively use auto / semi auto if you like. It’s just another way to achieve the same result. You'll learn how to control these modes - even though they have the word ‘auto’ in the name.

    Next you’ll learn how to be creative. How to 'see' and find photos, composition, lighting, how to add mood and feeling to a photo, give it meaning and be more than just a pretty picture.

    In the majority of lessons you will see actual settings, composition etc live in the camera’s viewfinder as techniques are explained and demonstrated in both home and real life on-location environments.

      In Adobe Illustrator, we will master the pen tool by hand tracing simple and complex shapes. We will explore the power of the shape builder tool and In the end of this section, we will design a complete logo design. There is an entirely new introduction and tools section that has been added where we work through a 7 page vector tracing worksheet and in the end create a complex vector illustration using our newly learned illustrator vector tools. Lastly, we will put together an event flyer to practice our layout skills, and even work through the branding process and create a logo, business card and letterhead for a business.
      
      We will will create a magazine layout in InDesign and learn the master pages tool to drastically speed up your design workflow when working with multiple paged layouts. `,

    title: 'Bridging Beauty and Function: The Art and Essence of Design',
    desc: `Design is a powerful and nuanced process that goes beyond mere aesthetics; it's about creating intentional and meaningful experiences. Whether it's crafting a visually stunning website, a user-friendly app, or a stylish product, design is the bridge that connects functionality with aesthetics, form with function. It involves understanding the needs and desires of the end user and translating those insights into a seamless and delightful solution. Effective design considers not just the visual elements, but also the user journey, accessibility, and the emotional response it evokes. It's a dynamic interplay of creativity, empathy, and problem-solving. Design is not just about making things look good; it's about making them work beautifully, creating a harmonious fusion of utility and elegance. In a world where first impressions matter, design is the silent storyteller that communicates brand identity and values. It's a language that speaks to the senses, influencing perceptions and shaping interactions. Whether in the digital realm or the tangible world, thoughtful and purposeful design has the power to enhance and elevate every aspect of our lives.`,
